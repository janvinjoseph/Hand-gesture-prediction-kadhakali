# Hand-gesture-prediction-kadhakali
A unique dataset with overall 16000 images is used for making a model in SVC. It can predict over 200 images and display the name within 3 seconds. Currently it will extract 20000 pixel extraction within an image which may vary based on clarity. It has an overall accuracy of 84 percent.
At first unzip the two files (both model and images) then simply run the project... if any issue persist pls mail me janvinjoseph@gmail.com
